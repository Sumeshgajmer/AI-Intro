### Intelligence

Scientists have proposed two major “consensus” definitions of intelligence:

- from Mainstream Science on Intelligence (1994);
A very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings- making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do.

- from Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns (1995);
Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, [and] to overcome obstacles by taking thought. Although these individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: a given person’s intellectual performance will vary on different occasions, in different domains, as judged by different criteria. Concepts of “intelligence” are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena. Thus, intelligence is:

           – the ability to reason
           – the ability to understand
           – the ability to create
           – the ability to Learn from experience
           – the ability to plan and execute complex tasks


### What is Artificial Intelligence?
#### "Giving machines ability to perform tasks normally associated with human intelligence."
AI is intelligence of machines and branch of computer science that aims to create it. AI consists of design of intelligent agents, which is a program that perceives its environment and takes action that maximizes its chance of success. With Ai it comes issues like deduction, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perceptron, etc. “Artificial Intelligence is the part of computer science concerned with designing intelligence computer systems, that is, systems that exhibit the characteristics we associate with intelligence in human behavior.”


### AI Perspective

#### Acting Humanly: The Turing Test Approach
The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950) was designed to convince the people that whether a particular machine can think or not. He suggested a test based on indistinguishability from undeniably intelligent entities- human beings. The test involves an interrogator who interacts with one human and one machine. Within a given time the interrogator has to find out which of the two the human is, and which one the machine.

The computer passes the test if a human interrogator after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written response come from human or not. To pass a Turing test, a computer must have following capabilities:
  - Natural Language Processing: Must be able to communicate successfully in English
  - Knowledge representation: To store what it knows and hears.
  - Automated reasoning: Answer the Questions based on the stored information.
  - Machine learning: Must be able to adapt in new circumstances.
Turing test avoid the physical interaction with human interrogator. Physical simulation of human beings is not necessary for testing the intelligence.

#### Thinking Humanly: Cognitive modeling approach
If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of determining how humans think. We need to get inside the actual workings of human minds. There are two ways to do this:
  - through introspection: catch our thoughts while they go by
  - through psychological experiments.

Once we have precise theory of mind, it is possible to express the theory as a computer program. The field of cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to try to construct precise and testable theories of the
workings of the human mind.

#### Think rationally: The laws of thought approach
Aristotal was one of the first who attempt to codify the right thinking that is irrefutable reasoning process. He gave Syllogisms that always yielded correct conclusion when correct premises are given.
    For example:
        Ram is a man
        All men are mortal
      - Ram is mortal
These law of thought were supposed to govern the operation of mind: This study initiated the field of logic. The logicist tradition in AI hopes to create intelligent systems using logic programming. However there are two obstacles to this approach. First, It is not easy to take informal knowledge and state in the formal terms required by logical notation, particularly when knowledge is not 100% certain. Second, solving problem principally is different from doing it in practice. Even problems with certain dozens of fact may exhaust the computational resources of any computer unless it has some guidance as which reasoning step to try first.

#### Acting Rationally: The rational Agent approach:
Agent is something that acts. Computer agent is expected to have following attributes:
- Autonomous control
- Perceiving their environment
- Persisting over a prolonged period of time
- Adapting to change
- And capable of taking on another’s goal
##### Rational behavior: doing the right thing.

The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information.
Rational Agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there isuncertainty, the best expected outcome. 

In the “laws of thought” approach to AI, the emphasis was given to correct inferences. Making correct inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one way to act rationally is to reason logically to the conclusion and act on that conclusion. On the other hand, there are also some ways of acting rationally that cannot be said to involve inference. For Example, recoiling from a hot stove is a reflex action that usually more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.



### Brief history of AI
